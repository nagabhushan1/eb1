    "# AWS Lab Exercise â€” IAM Role for EC2 Accessing S3 (Console Based)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸŽ¯ Objective\n",
    "Learn how to use **IAM Roles** to grant permissions to AWS services.  \n",
    "In this lab, you will create a role that allows an **EC2 instance** to access **S3** â€” without using any access keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§­ Overview\n",
    "You will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an IAM Role for EC2 with S3 ReadOnly permissions.  \n",
    "2. Launch an EC2 instance with that role.  \n",
    "3. Connect to EC2 and verify access to S3 using AWS CLI.  \n",
    "4. Validate that upload/delete actions are restricted.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to **IAM â†’ Roles â†’ Create role**.  \n",
    "2. Under **Trusted entity type**, select **AWS Service**.  \n",
    "3. Under Use Case, Choose **EC2** â†’ click **Next**.  \n",
    "4. Under **Permissions policies**, attach:  \n",
    "   - `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`  \n",
    "5. Click **Next**, then name the role:  \n",
    "   - `EC2_S3ReadOnlyRole`  \n",
    "6. Review and click **Create role**.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Concept:** The EC2_S3ReadOnlyRole grants temporary credentials to any EC2 instance it is attached to, allowing it to list and read data from S3.\n"

    "4. Under **Advanced Details â†’ IAM Instance Profile**, choose:  \n",
    "   - `EC2_S3ReadOnlyRole`  \n",
    "5. Select your existing **key pair** (e.g., `my-key`).  \n",
    "6. Keep the region as **us-east-1**.  \n",
    "7. Launch the instance.\n",
