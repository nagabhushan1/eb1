    "In this hands-on exercise, you will:\n",
    "1. Configure your AWS CLI credentials in PyCharm.\n",
    "2. Install required Python packages.\n",
    "3. Use `boto3` to connect to Amazon S3.\n",
    "4. Perform S3 operations programmatically.\n",
    "5. Verify the results directly from the AWS Console.\n",
