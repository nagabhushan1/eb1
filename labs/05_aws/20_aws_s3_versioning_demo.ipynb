    "# AWS S3 Versioning ‚Äî Managing Object Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Objective\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to use **Amazon S3 Versioning** to preserve, retrieve, and restore versions of your data by comparing two buckets ‚Äî one without versioning and another with versioning enabled.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### üß† Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|----------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Versioning** | Maintains multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. |\n",
    "| **Version ID** | Unique identifier assigned automatically to each version. |\n",
    "| **Delete Marker** | A placeholder that hides an object instead of deleting it permanently. |\n",
    "| **Suspended State** | Stops creating new versions but retains old ones. |\n",
