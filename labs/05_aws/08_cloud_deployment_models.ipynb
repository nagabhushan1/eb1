    "\n",
    "Cloud deployment options refer to the various ways in which cloud computing resources are **deployed, managed, and accessed**.  \n",
    "These options depend on the level of ownership, security, and integration desired by an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **five major deployment models**:  \n",
    "1. Public Cloud  \n",
    "2. Private Cloud  \n",
    "3. Hybrid Cloud  \n",
    "4. Multi-Cloud  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Shared infrastructure among multiple customers  \n",
    "- Cost-effective and scalable  \n",
    "- Managed entirely by the cloud provider  \n",
    "- Limited control and customization  \n",

    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Exclusive infrastructure for one organization  \n",
    "- Enhanced security and privacy  \n",
    "- High cost, but greater customization  \n",
    "- Can be hosted on-premise or by a third-party vendor  \n",
