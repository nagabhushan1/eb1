    "- CPU (Processor)\n",
    "- RAM (Memory)\n",
    "- Storage (Hard Disk)\n",

    "- Each application runs on its own **physical server**.\n",
    "- Servers often use only **30% of their capacity**, wasting valuable resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a virtualized environment:\n",
    "- A **hypervisor** (a software layer) divides the physical server into multiple **virtual machines**.\n",
    "- Each VM can run a different application (Java, Node.js, Python, etc.).\n",
