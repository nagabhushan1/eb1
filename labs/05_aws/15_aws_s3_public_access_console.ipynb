    "### üéØ Objective\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",

    "- Upload a dataset (`orders.csv`)\n",
    "- Understand **S3 public access settings**\n",
    "- Make the bucket/object publicly accessible\n",
    "- Verify access via **public URL in an incognito window**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Key Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- Understand S3‚Äôs default access controls (private by default)\n",
    "- Learn how to manage **Block Public Access** settings\n",
    "- Understand **Bucket Policies** and **Object Permissions**\n",
    "- Safely test and verify S3 object accessibility\n",

    "Before you start, ensure the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have an **AWS Account** with access to S3 service.  \n",
    "2. The dataset file `orders.csv` is available locally on your computer.  \n",

    "3. Enter a **unique bucket name**, for example:  \n",

    "|------|----------|--------------|\n",
    "| Create | S3 Bucket | Buckets are private by default |\n",
    "| Upload | Object Management | Uploaded data is secured until made public |\n",
    "| Access Test | Permission Model | ‚ÄúAccess Denied‚Äù validates private-by-default behavior |\n",
    "| Public Enable | ACL & Policy | Public access can be explicitly granted |\n",
    "| Verify | Object URL | Public access verified using incognito mode |\n",
    "| Revert | Security Practice | Always disable public access when testing is done |\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Key Learnings:**\n",
    "- S3 buckets and objects are private by default.  \n",
    "- Public access requires disabling block settings and setting ACLs.  \n",
    "- Always verify object accessibility before sharing URLs.  \n",
    "- Follow **security best practices** ‚Äî keep data private unless necessary.  \n",

    "### üß† **Summary**\n",
    "- Created and configured a private S3 bucket.  \n",
    "- Uploaded a dataset (`orders.csv`).  \n",
    "- Enabled and tested public access.  \n",
    "- Verified data accessibility through an incognito browser.  \n",
    "- Restored private access to ensure security.\n",
