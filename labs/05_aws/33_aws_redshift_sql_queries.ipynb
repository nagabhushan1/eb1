    "# 🧩 AWS Redshift SQL Queries Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Learn how to execute analytical SQL queries in Amazon Redshift using sample tables such as `sales`, `date`, and `users`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Lab Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "1. Connect to an existing **Redshift cluster**.\n",
    "2. Run analytical SQL queries from the **Query Editor v2** or any SQL client.\n",
    "3. Understand how to perform joins and aggregations for insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧠 **Note:** This lab assumes your Redshift cluster is already running and the sample data (tables `sales`, `date`, and `users`) is preloaded.\n"

    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning this lab, ensure the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Amazon Redshift Cluster** is active.  \n",
    "   - Cluster status: `available`\n",
    "   - Database name: e.g., `dev`\n",
    "   - User credentials: `admin` or equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Data Available**  \n",
    "   Required tables:\n",
    "   - `sales(dateid, buyerid, qtysold, ...)`\n",
    "   - `date(dateid, caldate, ...)`\n",
    "   - `users(userid, firstname, lastname, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL Access Options**\n",
    "   You can connect and run queries using any of the following:\n",
    "   - **Redshift Query Editor v2** in AWS Console  \n",
    "   - **DBeaver**, **SQL Workbench/J**, or **PyCharm Database Tool**  \n",
    "   - Command-line access via `psql`\n"

    "## 🧮 Query 1: Find Total Sales on a Given Calendar Date\n",
    "\n",
    "This query calculates the **total quantity sold** on a specific calendar date by joining the `sales` and `date` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT sum(qtysold)\n",
    "FROM sales, date\n",
    "WHERE sales.dateid = date.dateid\n",
    "AND caldate = '2008-01-06';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Explanation:\n",
    "- The `sales` table holds transaction data including `qtysold` (quantity sold).  \n",
    "- The `date` table provides the calendar date dimension.  \n",
    "- The query joins both tables using `dateid` and filters by a specific `caldate`.  \n",
    "- The result shows the total items sold on January 6, 2008.\n"

    "## 🧾 Query 2: Find Top 10 Buyers by Quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "This query identifies the top 10 buyers based on total quantity purchased and lists their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT firstname, lastname, total_quantity\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "    SELECT buyerid, sum(qtysold) AS total_quantity\n",
    "    FROM sales\n",
    "    GROUP BY buyerid\n",
    "    ORDER BY total_quantity DESC\n",
    "    LIMIT 10\n",
    ") Q, users\n",
    "WHERE Q.buyerid = userid\n",
    "ORDER BY Q.total_quantity DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Explanation:\n",
    "- The **subquery** aggregates sales by `buyerid` using `sum(qtysold)`.\n",
    "- It limits results to the **top 10 buyers** by total quantity.  \n",
    "- The **outer query** joins with the `users` table to fetch buyer names (`firstname`, `lastname`).  \n",
    "- Final results are sorted in descending order of `total_quantity`.\n"

    "## 🧠 Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you learned:\n",
    "- How to join tables in Redshift using implicit join syntax (`FROM A, B WHERE A.id = B.id`).  \n",
    "- How to use aggregation functions (`SUM`, `GROUP BY`) for analytical queries.  \n",
    "- How to identify top customers or summarize sales over time.\n",
