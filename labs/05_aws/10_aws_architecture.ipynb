    "\n",
    "## üåç Region\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Region?\n",
    "A Region is a geographically separated area where AWS hosts multiple data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Each Region operates independently, ensuring fault isolation and compliance with local regulations. AWS offers multiple Regions worldwide to provide low-latency access and disaster recovery capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In the diagram, all AWS resources (VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, databases) are created within a single Region such as **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)** to maintain proximity and minimize latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß± Availability Zone (AZ)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Availability Zone?\n",
    "An Availability Zone (AZ) is an isolated data center within a Region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and networking. Deploying resources across multiple AZs provides high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "The architecture shows multiple subnets distributed across AZs (e.g., **AZ1** and **AZ2**) to ensure that even if one AZ fails, the application remains operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåê Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a VPC?\n",
    "A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is your private network within AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "A VPC provides an isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can define IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways. It gives full control over inbound and outbound network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "The diagram‚Äôs entire infrastructure‚Äîpublic and private subnets, NAT Gateway, EC2, and RDS‚Äîresides inside a single **VPC**, ensuring security and controlled network flow.\n",

    "A subnet divides your VPC into smaller network segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Subnets can be public or private depending on accessibility. Public subnets connect through the Internet Gateway, while private subnets rely on NAT Gateway or internal routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In the diagram, web servers are hosted in **public subnets** (accessible via ALB), and **database servers** are in private subnets, isolated from direct Internet access.\n",
    "\n",

    "A route table defines how network traffic is directed within your VPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Each subnet must be associated with a route table that determines allowed network paths‚Äîfor example, to an Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, or Transit Gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Public subnets use a route table that points to the **Internet Gateway**, while private subnets use one that points to the **NAT Gateway** for outbound traffic.\n",
    "\n",
