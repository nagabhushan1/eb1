    "# AWS Lab Exercise — VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3 (Console Based)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create a **VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3** to allow your **Private Subnet EC2 instance (EC2-B)** to access Amazon S3 without using the Internet Gateway.  \n",
    "This ensures secure, private connectivity between your VPC and S3.\n",

    "   - **Public Subnet:** `VPC-A-Public`, CIDR `10.100.0.0/24`, Auto-assign public IP enabled.  \n",
    "   - **Private Subnet:** `VPC-A-Private`, CIDR `10.100.11.0/24`, Auto-assign public IP disabled.  \n",
    "4. Create a **Route Table** for each subnet:  \n",
    "   - Public route table: add route `0.0.0.0/0` → Internet Gateway.  \n",
    "   - Private route table: local route only.  \n",
    "5. Associate each route table with the corresponding subnet.\n"
