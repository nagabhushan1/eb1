    "# AWS Lab Exercise — IAM Groups, Users, and Custom Policies for EC2 Access Control (Console Based)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create IAM users and groups to manage access to EC2 instances with varying permissions.  \n",
    "You will also create a **custom IAM policy** that prevents instance termination, demonstrating granular control over EC2 actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario Overview\n",
    "You will perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create IAM users `dev01` and `dev02`  \n",
    "2. Create two IAM groups — `developer` and `developer_readonly`  \n",
    "3. Assign permissions:\n",
    "   - `developer` group → `AmazonEC2FullAccess`\n",
    "   - `developer_readonly` group → `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`\n",
    "4. Attach users to respective groups  \n",
    "5. Verify that `dev01` can create, stop, and terminate instances  \n",
    "6. Verify that `dev02` can only view instances (read-only)  \n",
    "7. Create a **custom policy** that *removes* the ability to terminate instances  \n",
    "8. Attach this custom policy to `developer` group  \n",
    "9. Re-test access for `dev01` → terminate should now be denied\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
