    "# What is Cloud Service Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Service Models describe **how cloud services are structured, delivered, and consumed**.  \n",
    "They define *who manages what* ‚Äî the cloud provider versus the cloud consumer ‚Äî and set the level of control, responsibility, and visibility for each side.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a cloud service model represents an agreement between two entities:\n",
    "- The **Cloud Provider** ‚Äî who offers computational resources.\n",
    "- The **Cloud Consumer** ‚Äî who uses those resources as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cloud service models are all about the **level of control consumers get** vs. the **responsibilities handled by the provider.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a provider says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll manage more for you,‚Äù that service is higher in the stack (like SaaS).  \n",
    "When the provider says, ‚ÄúYou manage more,‚Äù that‚Äôs lower in the stack (like IaaS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like renting computers instead of buying them ‚Äî you pay for what you need, use it when required, and let someone else maintain the rest.\n",

    "| Model | Full Form | Typical Use | Responsibility |\n",
    "|:------|:-----------|:-------------|:----------------|\n",
    "| **IaaS** | Infrastructure as a Service | Servers, Storage, Networking | Consumer manages software; Provider manages hardware |\n",
    "| **PaaS** | Platform as a Service | Development environment | Provider manages runtime, OS, and scaling |\n",
    "| **SaaS** | Software as a Service | End-user software | Provider manages everything |\n",

    "Cloud providers offer scalable computing environments where consumers can rent infrastructure components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "- Compute (VMs and CPUs)\n",
    "- Storage (Disks and Object Stores)\n",
    "- Networking (IP addresses, Load balancers, Firewalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- Pay-per-use model (measured services)\n",
    "- Full control over OS, middleware, and apps\n",

    "\n",
    "**Platform as a Service** sits above IaaS ‚Äî it provides a **preconfigured platform** for developers to build, test, and deploy applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provider manages infrastructure and runtime so developers can focus solely on writing code.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Function as a Service (FaaS)** ‚Äî often called *serverless computing* ‚Äî allows developers to **deploy individual functions** that execute in response to events, **without managing servers**.\n",
