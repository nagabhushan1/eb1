    "\n",
    "In 1990, **Bill Inmon**, known as the *Father of Data Warehousing*, defined four essential characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrated**  \n",
    "   - Data from multiple operational and external systems is combined into a unified format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subject-Oriented**  \n",
    "   - Data is organized by subject areas (e.g., customers, products, sales), not by application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time-Variant**  \n",
    "   - Contains **historical data** (not just current state), enabling trend analysis over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Non-Volatile**  \n",
    "   - Data is **stable between refresh cycles**.  \n",
    "   - New or updated data is loaded in periodic batches (e.g., nightly).  \n",
    "   - Once loaded, data is not modified by transactional updates.  \n"

    "Organizations invest time, resources, and money into building a data warehouse for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data-Driven Decision Making**  \n",
    "   - Decisions are based on reliable data, not just intuition or experience.  \n",
    "   - Enables analysis across past, present, and predictive (future) perspectives.  \n",
    "   - Even supports exploration of the *unknown* through advanced analytics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One-Stop Shopping**  \n",
    "   - All data is consolidated into a single repository.  \n",
    "   - Eliminates the need to gather scattered data from multiple operational systems.  \n",
    "   - Analysts can focus on *analysis*, not on repeatedly collecting and integrating data.  \n"
