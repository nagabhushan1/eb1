    "  - Requires strong **data governance** and cross-organizational cooperation.  \n",

    "- Data marts sit **before** the warehouse.  \n",
    "- Example: SAP NA vs SAP International → marts per system → partial data flows into warehouse.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Mart-Only Bus (Kimball Approach)\n",
    "- Proposed by *Ralph Kimball*.  \n",
    "- Based on **conformed dimensions** (consistent definitions across marts: customers, products, employees, geographies).  \n",
    "- Ensures “apples-to-apples” comparisons across marts.  \n",
