    "**Definition:** A transaction is *all or nothing*. If any part fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- A banking app transferring â‚¹ 500 from Arjun to Ramesh must update *two accounts*.\n",
    "- Atomicity ensures both updates happen together or none at all.\n",
    "- Transaction logs enable rollback if failure occurs."

    "**Definition:** A transaction must preserve all database rules and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Any data written must be valid according to rules, constraints, and triggers.\n",
    "- Example: balances cannot go negative. If withdrawal > balance, transaction fails."

    "- Isolation levels:\n",
    "  - Serializable (highest, safest, slowest)\n",
    "  - Read committed (prevents dirty reads)\n",

    "\n",

    "- **Dirty read:** T2 sees uncommitted changes from T1.\n",
    "- **Non-repeatable read:** Same query returns different results within same transaction."

    "**Definition:** Once a transaction is committed, it is permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Even if system crashes or loses power, committed data remains.\n",
    "- Achieved using **write-ahead logging (WAL)** or redo logs in Oracle.\n",
    "- In distributed databases, durability involves replication across nodes."
