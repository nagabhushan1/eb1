    "### Introduction\n",
    "This notebook explains the structure of **Apache Access Logs** (Combined Log Format). Each line in such a log file records one HTTP request handled by the server. Understanding these fields helps analyze user behavior, track performance, and detect errors.\n",

    "| **1. IP Address** | `79.133.215.123` | The IP address of the client (visitor) making the request. |\n",
    "| **2. Identity (RFC 1413)** | `-` | Client identity determined by identd (rarely used today). Usually `-`. |\n",
    "| **3. User ID (AuthUser)** | `-` | The username if HTTP authentication was used; otherwise `-`. |\n",
    "| **4. Timestamp** | `[14/Jun/2014:10:30:13 -0400]` | Date and time when the request was received. `-0400` indicates timezone offset from UTC. |\n",
    "| **5. Request Line** | `\"GET /home HTTP/1.1\"` | The HTTP request line including method (`GET`), resource path (`/home`), and protocol version (`HTTP/1.1`). |\n",
    "| **6. Status Code** | `200` | The HTTP response status code â€” `200` for success, `404` for not found, `500` for server error, etc. |\n",
    "| **7. Response Size** | `1671` | The size of the object returned to the client in bytes. |\n",
    "| **8. Referrer** | `\"-\"` | The URL of the page that referred the client to this resource. `\"-\"` means none. |\n",
    "| **9. User-Agent** | `\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64)...\"` | Information about the browser or client software making the request. |\n",

    "\n",
    "- Count requests per IP address.\n",
    "- Identify the most visited pages.\n",
    "- Detect 404 (page not found) errors.\n",
    "- Understand user browsers (based on User-Agent).\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "Apache Access Logs provide a detailed record of every request handled by a web server. Each line helps in understanding **who** accessed the server, **when**, **what resource**, and **how** the server responded.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python, PySpark, or tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to analyze these logs for insights into website performance and user activity.\n"
