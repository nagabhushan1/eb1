    "# Difference Between OLTP HR Schema and Star Schema (DWH)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the difference between two schema diagrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Star Schema (Data Warehouse model)** – optimized for analytics, with fact and dimension tables.\n",
    "2. **Oracle HR OLTP Schema (3NF)** – optimized for transactional operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Purpose & Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Star schema (DW):** Optimized for **reporting & analytics** (read-heavy, aggregations, dashboards).\n",
    "- **OLTP HR schema:** Optimized for **transactions** (insert/update/delete, enforcing integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Grain & Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fact table (`employee_salary_fact`):** Grain = salary snapshot at a specific effective date. Measures include salary, bonus, total compensation.\n",
    "- **OLTP:** Measures are attributes inside `employees` and history in `job_history`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DW:** Uses surrogate keys (`RAW(16)`), enables Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).\n",
    "- **OLTP:** Uses natural/business keys (`employee_id`, `department_id`, `job_id`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Normalization vs. Denormalization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DW:** Denormalized – e.g., `location_dim` flattens location + country + region.\n",
    "- **OLTP:** Normalized (3NF) – separate `locations`, `countries`, `regions`. Avoids redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. History Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DW:** SCD (Type 2) captures multiple versions of employee/job/department over time.\n",
    "- **OLTP:** `job_history` captures employment changes with start/end dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Time Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DW:** `time_dim` provides year, quarter, month, fiscal attributes for reporting.\n",
    "- **OLTP:** Stores raw dates (`hire_date`, `start_date`, `end_date`). No fiscal/calendar logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Querying\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DW:** Simple queries – fact joins directly to dimensions. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT d.department_name, SUM(f.total_compensation)\n",
    "FROM employee_salary_fact f\n",
    "JOIN department_dim d ON f.surrogate_department_id = d.surrogate_department_id\n",
    "GROUP BY d.department_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OLTP:** Complex joins across many tables. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT r.region_name, c.country_name, l.city, d.department_name, e.salary\n",
    "FROM employees e\n",
    "JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id\n",
    "JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id\n",
    "JOIN countries c ON l.country_id = c.country_id\n",
    "JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. ETL Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "- `employee_dim` ⟵ employees (+ derived attributes like full_name, tenure_band)\n",
    "- `department_dim` ⟵ departments\n",
    "- `job_dim` ⟵ jobs (+ job_category)\n",
    "- `location_dim` ⟵ locations + countries + regions\n",
    "- `time_dim` ⟵ generated calendar\n",
    "- `employee_salary_fact` ⟵ employees + job_history\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Star schema:** Surrogate keys, denormalized, SCD support, time dimension, optimized for analytics.\n",
    "- **HR OLTP schema:** Business keys, normalized, integrity constraints, optimized for transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n"
