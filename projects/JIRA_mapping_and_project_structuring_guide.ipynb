    "|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Module** | A functional area or feature of the project. Represents *what* part of the system is being built. | Data Ingestion, Data Processing, Query & Reporting |\n",
    "| **Sprint** | A short, time-boxed period (usually 1‚Äì2 weeks) that defines *when* the work is done. | Sprint 1 ‚Äì AWS Setup & Initialization |\n",
    "| **Task** | An actionable, measurable activity that contributes to module completion. | Upload datasets to S3, Create IAM roles, Run Glue job |\n",

    "## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Project Structuring\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a consistent naming and structuring convention helps maintain clarity, professionalism, and easy tracking in JIRA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Naming Conventions\n",
    "| Item | Recommended Format | Example |\n",
    "|------|--------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Epics (Modules)** | EPIC ‚Äì <Module Name> | EPIC ‚Äì Data Processing |\n",
    "| **Sprints** | Sprint <Number> ‚Äì <Short Goal> | Sprint 1 ‚Äì AWS Setup & Initialization |\n",
    "| **Tasks** | <Action Verb> + <Object> | Create IAM role for EMR |\n",
    "| **Files / Scripts** | Use lowercase with hyphens | `spark-agg1.py`, `emr-job-trigger.py` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Task Writing Style\n",
    "- Keep each task **action-oriented** and **clear** (e.g., ‚ÄúRun Glue Crawler for bronze zone‚Äù).  \n",
    "- Avoid generic phrasing like ‚ÄúDo ETL work‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrepare everything.‚Äù  \n",
    "- Ensure each task is **measurable** and **completable within a sprint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sprint Definition\n",
    "- Each sprint should have a **clear goal**, **defined dates**, and **deliverables**.  \n",
    "- Avoid overlapping tasks between sprints.  \n",
    "- Mark incomplete tasks for carryover transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Epic (Module) Structure\n",
    "- Every project should have 5‚Äì6 Epics (Modules) maximum for clarity.  \n",
    "- Each Epic should contain multiple related tasks spread across sprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Visual Clarity in JIRA\n",
    "- Use **labels** to tag tasks (e.g., `glue`, `athena`, `pyspark`).  \n",
    "- Maintain consistent color-coding for Epics.  \n",
    "- Keep sprint names short and descriptive to avoid truncation in the JIRA board.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. General Guidelines\n",
    "- Keep all terminology **aligned with AWS services** used in the project.  \n",
    "- Maintain identical naming style across all teams for professional uniformity.  \n",
    "- Ensure project leads review sprint scopes before importing tasks into JIRA.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, every learner can confidently map their AWS-based project from notebook ‚Üí backlog ‚Üí JIRA board, ensuring transparency and progress tracking across all teams.\n"
