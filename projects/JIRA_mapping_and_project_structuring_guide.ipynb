    "## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Project Structuring\n",
    "\n",
    "Adhering to consistent structuring and naming conventions improves visibility, simplifies tracking, and ensures alignment across teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Naming Conventions\n",
    "| Element | Recommended Format | Example |\n",
    "|----------|--------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Epics (Modules)** | EPIC ‚Äì <Module Name> | EPIC ‚Äì Data Processing |\n",
    "| **Sprints** | Sprint <Number> ‚Äì <Short Goal> | Sprint 1 ‚Äì AWS Setup & Initialization |\n",
    "| **Tasks** | <Action Verb> + <Object> | Create IAM role for EMR |\n",
    "| **Files / Scripts** | Lowercase with hyphens | `spark-transform.py`, `glue-job-etl.py` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Task Writing Style\n",
    "- Each task should begin with an **action verb** (e.g., Create, Configure, Deploy, Test).  \n",
    "- Keep tasks **specific and measurable**.  \n",
    "- Avoid vague or generic phrasing like ‚ÄúDo ETL work.‚Äù  \n",
    "- Ensure every task is **achievable within one sprint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sprint Definition\n",
    "- Define a clear **goal**, **start‚Äìend dates**, and **deliverable** for each sprint.  \n",
    "- Do not overload sprints with loosely related tasks.  \n",
    "- Carry forward incomplete tasks transparently to the next sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Epic (Module) Organization\n",
    "- Maintain 5‚Äì6 Epics per project for optimal clarity.  \n",
    "- Assign related tasks under the correct Epic for accurate tracking.  \n",
    "- Review Epic‚ÄìTask relationships regularly during sprint planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Visual Consistency in JIRA\n",
    "- Apply **labels** for AWS components (e.g., `glue`, `athena`, `emr`, `kinesis`).  \n",
    "- Keep **Epic colors consistent** across projects (e.g., data ingestion = blue, analytics = green).  \n",
    "- Use concise naming to prevent truncation in JIRA dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. General Guidelines\n",
    "- Align terminology with AWS services used in the project.  \n",
    "- Maintain identical sprint naming conventions across all teams.  \n",
    "- Document module boundaries and responsibilities before sprint kickoff.  \n",
    "- Conduct a brief sprint review at the end of each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these practices ensures a unified, professional workflow where all teams structure, track, and present their project progress consistently in JIRA.\n"
